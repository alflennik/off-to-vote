          <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
          <p>
            The shrinking of polling volunteers fearing COVID-19, combined with
            the closing of polling stations, has led to huge lines of people
            waiting to vote in recent elections. It is not ok. We believe no one
            should have to give up on their voting rights because of their job.
            We believe employers should support their employees’ voting rights
            and give them the flexibility to stand in line to cast their ballot.
            We believe every vote counts.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
          <h3>Isn’t this already a law?</h3>
          <p>
            Giving employees time off to cast a ballot is not a federal
            obligation for employers. Some states, including Tennessee and
            Alaska, mandate employers to give employees (paid) time to vote.
            Others, including Connecticut and Idaho, have zeo voter-leave laws.
            Some, like Oklahoma and New York, have exceptions that can make it
            difficult for employees to stand up for their rights. Confusing,
            right? Here’s a 2018 article that details the laws, state by state.

          <p>
            We hear you. But it’s not going to happen before November 3, 2020.
            So in the meantime, thanks for considering taking the offtovote.org

            your day on November 3, 2020, to make sure you have enough time to
            cast your ballot. It shouldn’t have to take that long and we hope it

            We ask that you give all your employees the option to take 4 hours

            some of your employees may want to use this time to help others get
            to the polls safely. It’s the right thing to do.

              as possible, we recommend sharing the news with your employees by
              October 27, 2020 (the Tuesday prior to Election Day) so your team
              can get organized, whether that means staggering shifts or “out of
